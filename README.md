Describe my first day with GitHub and my SmallBASIC projects status

OK, can I really just journal here instead of my laptop?

Ok, but it's going to be pulblic so watch your language and such.

OK, say does that remind anybody else of any old thing? the OK's I mean...

OK, we are back to that!

OK?

Well I guess that can get old quick enough!

Speaking of Quick does that remind anybody of any old thing?

Maybe?

Speaking of old things let's go way, way, way back to the times before monitors, electric screens, PC's

Do you remember scrolling Star Trek programs on paper printouts?

Reams and reams... Oh boy! we might not have spellllllchecker here, oh boy we are in trouble now...

Sorry, I will apologize in advance, no spellchecker

Oh well can't have everything, but we can try.

My first day with GitHub what an adventure:
  Well we do have tab. I when to bed totally defeated, dead, but...
  Oh we have tab, but try and untab! OK
  It work's too, the tab, the look of the print on the page.
  
  I look up and see Soft Wrap, what's that?
  
  By the way, I said goodbye to my regular WP, I wonder if the copy is still under the mouse:
  
  Tuesday, October 28, 2014
4.42a I got GitHub yesterday, big event! I also got a very humbling lesson from the Geeks. Windows has spoiled me from typing. Talking through my fingers instead of my mouse. <actually it's vice versa? except when not! in J =Journaling>
I have 2 doors now on my desk top. Save all this for Github!
   Goodbye Open Office Writer you have been pretty good but I am going to GitHub where the walls might have ears!

Hey! pretty good! <OK the paste worked, it was like 30 minutes ago when I copied it and got lost exploring GitHub.>

I realized while chatting in SmallBASIC Forum, trying to help someone who I am sure was long gone, that the perfect EditBox control was one that had ears. One that had friendly AI behind it with stuff like Spellchecker, WIKI, a dictionary, grammer and Snytax and/but also really good AI, "hey bud, you are barking up the wrong tree. been there, done that, it won't work because X,Y,Z.... well at least it didn't work for me because of X, Y, Z but you can try it and find out for yourself, i am just saying..."

That kind of AI, the Human kind! That is kindly offering personal experience. THAT is the perfect EditBox Control for Windows or anybody!

Oh maybe that is here already, right here and now with GitHub, WoW Imagine That, that's IT, the thing to git!

So I have editors and editing on my mind already and when I explored GitHub when I learned that Editors are probably the nearest and dearest thing to a Developers Heart. Who does not remember their first editor? Mine was a punch card machine! I go way back! Punch Cards and "Dummy" terminals where you had to compete with the "Townies" in the basement of the math building who are going through reams and reams of paper for their Star Trek maps or whatever. You hate to take them away from their fun but you have math homework to do and your parents probably paid for the paper they are running through...

Anyway where was I? Editors, EditBox... why am I talking about that? Why is that on my mind in 80 million levels?

SmallBASIC doesn't have such a thing and I want to give it one. Like I did with QB long long ago before there was VB <VB for ME>. It will be all in .bas code so you can tweek the control anyway you want, just like my old QB project. Try and do that with the other Small Basic, MS style. "Kid Basic" is what I call that, "it's not small, not the coding lines. It's not small with the support behind the project either. Are you kidding me? What's Small about that? It's a joke right?"

Nope, they have serious agenda get the kids going with VB type graphics prep them for a life of VB and MS product.

Pretty smart, remember what I said about first editors? they are heart and soul of developers?

Am I wrong?

I like SmallBASIC because it is charmingly small. I have a perverse taste for simplicity. First editors, remember. That's my current project but I am very reluctant to proceed. This is one I have done before, it's allot of work just getting the BASIC editor stuff that everyone expects from any "editbox" and what am I doing, reinventing the wheel? really do i have to? PLus I am not dealing with a full set of ASCII codes for all the keys. Some quirky thing Chris says he will fix "soonish". That's OK Chris, the less the merrier! the less the smaller! the less the less I have to code, I have my excuse, Thank You very much...

But think about it, how do you do an editor without Menu Controls or Other Buttons to signal when you are done for one thing or that you want to quit for another? God Windows has me brainwashed, you do it through the keys dummy, you don't have to have buttons, you don't have to have a mouse either!

But not all the keys are working... Home doesn't even return a number! I was shocked!

But there are enough keys, enough to build a very very BASIC editbox.

An editbox that kids could understand because it is so BASIC you can look right insoide<?> and see how the code works.
Kids young and old could go in and tweeak it to work the way they want. 
(Sometimes spelling mistakes are Happy Accidents, we should not be so quick to spellcheck everything.)
Isn't a tweak better than a tweet?
No these days you can do both, have it your way. I like that! <My way gets me fat and lazy, got to be careful with ways.>

That must be what the cat is about, and is that really a tentacle for a tail I saw? Cool symbology, I git it.

The cat is about independence right, freedom to go your own way, if you insist.. cool cat. Maybe with shades...
<But up close the tail is a tentacle, a connection to power... and those ears, so close to being horns...>

As it is it reminds me of Hello Kitty, that's kid's stuff isn't it? Or are we trying to be kid friendly?
The Kitty is a Trojan Horse. Look at it's insides! Full of Greeks or geeks take your pick it's all greek to me.

God i had a hell of a time following the <GitHub> tutorial. Round and round in circle we went because the stupid thing wouldn't work as I expected it to. Yeah I know i am the stupid one. I was also getting hungry after going through a pot of coffee, I was already getting cranky but I was stuck in this loop of misunderstanding so many ways and means... I still don't have it figured out but today is another day. I can't even articulate in words what the problem is, if I could do that then the problem is more than half solved because there certainly is plenty of help here hanging around in all the nooks and crannies.

Here the walls have ears, at least potentially. Big Brother is watching, big brother was probably watching back in my other WP so let's just make it official. You are out there, and I acknowledge it. Paranoid, paravoid...

Remember the perfect EditBox...

7.48a and through my first 4 cups of jo. That reminds some Java Script guy said, "You don't know J S." 
He's right, I don't know J S but I got that one! I got to break, "fo mo jo".

7.58p yeah so what's the record for longest README files? I have 20+ years of pent up yakking about code, I am full of... I know.

yeah yeah yeah like the Beatles song...

Of more recent times and experiences:

How much can you take in one sitting? It seems like I have allot to say but maybe it's just enthusiasm I am full of.

With my SmallBASIC package I downloaded from Source Forge (good god it's free now! in a week I try out 3 Basic's and then later Small Basic, MS style, because people are wondering off the streets to SmallBASIC's Forum looking for that. And i am looking for BASIC people to talk with... we are a match!) 
With my SmallBASIC package came a gem called TinyBasic I played with for a week and then I found ELIZA!
ELIZA.Bas, i finally get to check "her" out. What a beauty! for what now 50 years?
About a hundred lines of code the rest Data, and yet what effect!

Well I have already raved and B'd about "her" in SmallBASIC Forum no need to repeat again.

I did fix her up alittle, removed her line numbers, added stuff so "she" could handle punctuation and not screwup the Keyword searches. But then i performed sugary (sometimes I do it intentioanlly, wordplay) on her and removed her personality to a "Script" file and left myself a "Player" and then started writing my own scripts. You know like records for players, and like actors, and like a writers character coming alive and start speaking their own minds in the play in the mind. So i am Doctor Dolittle to her or Pygmalian. The whole performance is mythic. She and I merged, we have offspring now with all sorts of potential. I am the proud father of god knows what?

I have a whole new respect for talking to walls. Specially when they might be listening. It fires me up. 
...AND IF NOT (anybody >=1) THEN
  ? "So what! So what, ELSE is new?"
  ? "<Alone again, naturally.>"
  'fi it is in SmallBASIC, get it, IF starts it, so FI ends it, kind of clever I thought. Did that come from C? I never saw    'C.
FI

By the way, one of my early versions of ELIZA's transformation was called AZILE.
And I made a graphic pyramid shape with a face out of ASCII, just like the old day's.
"You are talking to the Great Pryamid of Egypt, buddy, show some respect for the mysteries I hold."
"Azile is joy in Hebrew." according to some word search...

8.45a now for me. I guess you are getting old when you rather talk about code than actaully write the stuff. 
The ideas so out run what is humanly possible. 

Let's talk projects, I am complete ametaur with this GitHub stuff (and spelling too but like I said that can be fun) but I would like to give something back to the kids. To the kid in all of us, that are Zen Masters of exploring and learning the world. To the future generations of Developers. Do we have to start them off with graphics MS style?

How do you guys do it in the Free World? what are your first Code editors? were they long.longer.more(keywords)?

I doubt it.

Is anyone thinking ahead about the future developers besides MS? 

and me?

MGA, I use to sign off with a Date Time stamp version number of myself, not needed here, not according to lit of git.
9.34a I got tired of sitting here amusing myself and got hungry.
